#### Known Issue: Higurashi on Ubuntu (or Linux users with GNOME Desktop)


GNOME Desktop (the default on Ubuntu) *may* cause Higurashi Ep.4 and upwards to crash the entire desktop when you start the game.

We've had varying reports - Ubuntu 19.10 with GNOME 3.34.2. seems to work (except for a crash in Tatarigoroshi on first startup). But previously we've had crash reports from anyone using GNOME. This happens even on the base game (without any mods applied).

If you have this issue, a workaround is to install XFCE desktop. You can follow [this guide](https://linuxconfig.org/how-to-install-xubuntu-desktop-on-ubuntu-18-04-bionic-beaver-linux) to install XFCE desktop (it can be installed alongside GNOME). Please make sure you can launch the base game before applying any mods (for ease of installation, please don't make any saves on the base game).
