# Installation Instructions

- **Please download the installer to your computer, then run it - don't run directly from your browser**
- Please read the [Higurashi](https://07th-mod.com/wiki/Higurashi/Higurashi-Getting-started/) or [Umineko](https://07th-mod.com/wiki/Umineko/Umineko-Getting-started/) wiki sections for more information.

## Troubleshooting and Known Issues

- If you are having installer trouble, or the game does not run properly, follow the [**Support Checklist**](https://07th-mod.com/wiki/support-checklist/) to solve your problem
- **MacOS users may need to refresh the webpage (web GUI) if it does not load or seems to hang**.

## Windows Installer Variants Explanation

1. `07th-Mod.Installer.Windows.exe` (Requires Administrator)
    - Default Installer - **Try this first**.
2. `07th-Mod.Installer.Windows.SafeMode.exe` (Requires Administrator)
    - Use this if the installer does not start up. It uses a text-based interface for the launcher.
3. `07th-Mod.Installer.Windows.NoLauncher.zip` (No Administrator Required)
     - Use this if you cannot launch the above two .exes due to Antivirus, lack of Admin Priviledge, or crashes
     - You might need to install the [Visual C++ Redistributable (x86)](https://aka.ms/vs/16/release/vc_redist.x86.exe) ([linked from this page](https://support.microsoft.com/en-au/topic/the-latest-supported-visual-c-downloads-2647da03-1eea-4433-9aff-95f26a218cc0)), but most people will already have it.
     - Extract the `.zip` file to your desktop or downloads folder (NOT program files or the game root, as this may cause permissions issues)
     - Double click on the `install.bat` file.
        - A terminal will open, followed by a special page in your web browser (you use this webpage to install the mod).
        - If the `install.bat` does not work, close the terminal, then double click the `install_safe_mode.bat` for the text-only installer
