### Installation Instructions

- **Please download the installer to your computer, then run it - don't run directly from your browser**
- Please read the [Higurashi](https://07th-mod.com/wiki/Higurashi/Higurashi-Getting-started/) or [Umineko](https://07th-mod.com/wiki/Umineko/Umineko-Getting-started/) wiki sections for more information.

### Known Issues

- **You may need to refresh the webpage (web GUI) if it does not load or seems to hang**.
    - This will happen for MacOS users / Python 2 / Python 3.6 and below using the Chrome web browser (Firefox seems to be OK)
    - This shouldn't happen on Windows builds / Python 3.7 and up as we've applied a fix

  <summary><b>Linux: Higurashi with GNOME Desktop/Ubuntu Crashes - CLICK TO EXPAND</b></summary>

GNOME Desktop (the default on Ubuntu) *may* cause Higurashi Ep.4 and upwards to crash the entire desktop when you start the game.

We've had varying reports - Ubuntu 19.10 with GNOME 3.34.2. seems to work (except for a crash in Tatarigoroshi on first startup). But previously we've had crash reports from anyone using GNOME. This happens even on the base game (without any mods applied).

If you have this issue, a workaround is to install XFCE desktop. You can follow [this guide](https://linuxconfig.org/how-to-install-xubuntu-desktop-on-ubuntu-18-04-bionic-beaver-linux) to install XFCE desktop (it can be installed alongside GNOME).

Please make sure you can launch the base game before applying any mods (please don't make any saves on the base game as they are not compatible with the mod).
