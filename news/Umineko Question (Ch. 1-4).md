## WARNING: 02/05/2019

We have had a couple reports of performance problems for Chapters 5-8, even on high end PCs.
On very low end PCs (like atom CPU laptops with integrated graphics), this is expected, but not on high end PCs.

Firstly, please launch the game unmodded to check the game works correctly without mods. Please do not make any
saves though, as saves from the unmodded game are not compatible.

Please make sure to close all CPU intensive programs in the background (even your web browser!). This is because the
game uses the CPU for graphics rendering, and is single threaded, so even if you have a multicore processor
it can only ever use one core.

It's also possible for a poor performing hard disk to cause performance problems, as images are loaded
by the engine each time they are displayed (as far as we know).

If you still have problems, please post your CPU and GPU specs and a description of how
the lag appears on our Discord (click the troubleshooting button) for us to analyse.

If you figure out what's causing the problem, please let us know as we really want to sort this issue out.
